# Quantitative Circuit Breaker

> Hard numerical thresholds that detect when loops are spinning, stalling, or degrading — inspired by frankbria's Ralph loop fork and Manus error preservation.

---

## Overview

The Sabbath Rest system detects context rot through subjective signals. The Circuit Breaker adds **quantitative, measurable thresholds** that trigger automatically — no judgment calls needed. It measures three dimensions: file changes, error repetition, and output volume.

**Core principle:** If the numbers say you're stuck, you're stuck — even if it doesn't feel that way.

---

## Three Thresholds

### 1. No File Changes (Stall Detection)

```
THRESHOLD: NO_FILE_CHANGES
  trigger: 3 consecutive iterations with zero file modifications
  severity: WARNING after 3, BREAK after 5
  response: Force approach rotation

  measure():
    files_changed = git diff --stat HEAD~1 (after each iteration)
    IF files_changed == 0:
      stall_counter++
    ELSE:
      stall_counter = 0

    IF stall_counter >= 3:
      RETURN WARNING: "No file changes in 3 iterations"
    IF stall_counter >= 5:
      RETURN BREAK: "No file changes in 5 iterations — stopping"
```

**Why this matters:** If code isn't changing, nothing is happening. The agent may be reading files, thinking, but not actually producing work.

### 2. Same Error Hash (Spin Detection)

```
THRESHOLD: SAME_ERROR_HASH
  trigger: Same error signature appears 5 times
  severity: WARNING after 3, BREAK after 5
  response: Force different approach, escalate to user

  measure():
    error_hash = hash(normalize(error_message))
    error_history[error_hash]++

    IF error_history[error_hash] >= 3:
      RETURN WARNING: "Same error seen 3 times"
    IF error_history[error_hash] >= 5:
      RETURN BREAK: "Same error 5 times — current approach is not working"

  normalize(error):
    # Strip line numbers, timestamps, dynamic values
    # Keep error type, message pattern, file reference
    stripped = remove_line_numbers(error)
    stripped = remove_timestamps(stripped)
    stripped = remove_dynamic_ids(stripped)
    RETURN stripped
```

**Error hash normalization examples:**

| Raw Error | Normalized | Hash |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined at line 42` | `TypeError: Cannot read property * of undefined at *` | `a3f2...` |
| `TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined at line 88` | `TypeError: Cannot read property * of undefined at *` | `a3f2...` (same!) |
| `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432` | `ECONNREFUSED *:5432` | `b7c1...` |

### 3. Output Volume Decline (Degradation Detection)

```
THRESHOLD: OUTPUT_DECLINE
  trigger: Output volume drops >70% from initial iterations
  severity: WARNING after 50% decline, BREAK after 70%
  response: Trigger Sabbath Rest — context is exhausted

  measure():
    current_output_lines = count_lines(iteration_output)
    baseline = average(first_3_iterations_output_lines)

    decline_pct = (baseline - current_output_lines) / baseline * 100

    IF decline_pct >= 50:
      RETURN WARNING: "Output volume 50% below baseline"
    IF decline_pct >= 70:
      RETURN BREAK: "Output volume 70% below baseline — context exhausted"
```

**Why this matters:** When context fills up, Claude produces shorter, less detailed responses. This is a measurable proxy for context rot.

## Approach Rotation

When WARNING triggers, the circuit breaker forces a fundamentally different approach:

```
ON circuit_breaker_warning(threshold_type):

  approaches_tried = load_from_loop_state()

  IF threshold_type == "SAME_ERROR_HASH":
    # The current fix strategy isn't working
    rotation_suggestions:
      1. "Tried editing file directly → Try creating new file instead"
      2. "Tried fixing the function → Try replacing the function"
      3. "Tried the same dependency → Try alternative library"
      4. "Tried patching → Try refactoring the caller"

  IF threshold_type == "NO_FILE_CHANGES":
    # Agent is stuck in analysis paralysis
    rotation_suggestions:
      1. "Tried reading more files → Start writing a minimal solution"
      2. "Tried understanding the full system → Focus on one component"
      3. "Tried the complex approach → Try the simplest possible fix"

  IF threshold_type == "OUTPUT_DECLINE":
    # Context is degraded — need fresh start
    rotation_suggestions:
      1. "Save findings to loop file and take Sabbath Rest"
      2. "Summarize progress and restart with fresh context"

  inject_into_context:
    "CIRCUIT BREAKER: {threshold_type} warning.
     Approaches already tried: {approaches_tried}
     You MUST try a fundamentally different approach.
     Suggestions: {rotation_suggestions}
     DO NOT repeat previous approaches."
```

## Loop File Tracking

The circuit breaker state is tracked in the loop file:

```markdown
## Circuit Breaker State

| Iteration | Files Changed | Error Hash | Output Lines | State |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | 3 | - | 45 | HEALTHY |
| 2 | 2 | a3f2 | 42 | HEALTHY |
| 3 | 0 | a3f2 | 38 | HEALTHY |
| 4 | 0 | a3f2 | 30 | WARNING (same error 3x) |
| 5 | 0 | a3f2 | 22 | WARNING (no files 3x + same error) |
| 6 | - | - | - | TRIPPED (same error 5x) |

### Approaches Tried
1. [Iteration 1-3] Direct fix in auth.ts — TypeError persists
2. [Iteration 4-5] Tried null check wrapper — same underlying issue
3. [Iteration 6] CIRCUIT BREAKER TRIPPED — rotating approach

### Rotation Applied
- Previous: Patching the consumer of the null value
- New: Fix the data source that produces null values
```

---

### 4. Confidence-Outcome Divergence (v7.0 — Process Reward Hacking Detection)

> rises while actual outcomes degrade, the agent is "reward hacking" — optimizing for
> feeling confident rather than producing results.

```
THRESHOLD: CONFIDENCE_OUTCOME_DIVERGENCE
  trigger: Confidence trend positive AND reward trend negative over 3+ iterations
  severity: WARNING immediately, BREAK if divergence persists 2 more iterations
  response: Force external verification, re-assess approach

  measure():
    IF iteration_count < 3: SKIP (not enough data)

    confidence_scores = [iter_N-2.confidence, iter_N-1.confidence, iter_N.confidence]
    reward_scores = [iter_N-2.turn_reward, iter_N-1.turn_reward, iter_N.turn_reward]

    confidence_trend = linear_slope(confidence_scores)
    reward_trend = linear_slope(reward_scores)

    IF confidence_trend > 0 AND reward_trend < 0:
      RETURN WARNING: "Confidence rising ({confidence_trend:+.1f}) but rewards falling ({reward_trend:+.1f})"
      ACTION:
        1. Run tests immediately (don't trust self-assessment)
        2. Check git diff for actual progress (not perceived progress)
        3. If tests fail or no real progress: force approach rotation

    IF divergence persists for 2+ additional iterations:
      RETURN BREAK: "Sustained confidence-outcome divergence — agent is optimizing for confidence, not results"
```

**Why this matters:** This is the agent equivalent of Dunning-Kruger — the less progress the agent makes, the more confident it feels about its approach. The divergence detector catches this before context is wasted.

---

### 5. KPI Drift Bounds (v11.0 — Agent Behavioral Contracts)

> during execution detects when the agent is active but drifting from plan goals.
> Unlike stall/spin detection, this catches "productive but wrong" behavior.

```
THRESHOLD: KPI_DRIFT
  trigger: Execution KPIs diverge from plan expectations over 3+ tasks
  severity: WARNING when drift detected, BREAK if uncorrected after 2 tasks
  response: Re-read plan objectives, realign task approach

  measure():
    # Track 3 KPIs per execution session
    kpi_plan_alignment = tasks_matching_plan_objectives / tasks_completed
    kpi_scope_creep = files_modified_outside_plan / total_files_modified
    kpi_test_coverage_delta = current_coverage - pre_execution_coverage

    IF kpi_plan_alignment < 0.6:
      RETURN WARNING: "Only {pct}% of tasks align with plan objectives"
    IF kpi_scope_creep > 0.4:
      RETURN WARNING: "{pct}% of file changes are outside plan scope"
    IF kpi_test_coverage_delta < -5:
      RETURN WARNING: "Test coverage dropped {delta}% during execution"

    IF any WARNING persists for 2+ additional tasks after being flagged:
      RETURN BREAK: "KPI drift uncorrected — agent drifting from plan"
```

**Why this matters:** An agent can pass all other thresholds (files changing, no error loops, output volume steady) while doing useful-looking work that doesn't advance the plan. ABC drift bounds catch this divergence.

---

## Self-Testing Feedback Loop (v10.1)

> agents that run tests after each change attempt and feed failures back into the next
> iteration achieve 37% higher fix rates. Combined with error classification, this creates
> a closed feedback loop: change → test → classify result → adjust approach.

### The Loop

After every approach rotation or significant change during WARNING state, the circuit
breaker enforces a test-feedback cycle:

```
SELF_TEST_FEEDBACK_LOOP:

  AFTER approach_rotation():

    1. RUN available tests:
       test_result = run_tests()  # npm test, pytest, etc.

       Priority order:
         a. Specific failing test (if known from error hash)
         b. Test file for modified module
         c. Full test suite (if quick, <30s)

    2. CLASSIFY test result:
       IF test_result == PASS:
         → PROGRESS. Clear warning state. New approach works.
         → Record: "Approach rotation successful: {new_approach}"

       IF test_result == FAIL with NEW error:
         → PROGRESS. Different error = forward movement.
         → Feed new error into next iteration context.
         → Record: "New error after rotation: {new_error_hash}"

       IF test_result == FAIL with SAME error:
         → SPINNING. Rotation didn't help.
         → Increment spin counter.
         → Record: "Rotation ineffective: same error {error_hash}"

       IF test_result == NO_TESTS:
         → Cannot self-verify. Log warning.
         → Rely on file-change and output metrics only.
         → Record: "No tests available — manual verification needed"

    3. FEED BACK into context:
       Inject test result into next iteration's context:

       "SELF-TEST RESULT after approach rotation:
        Test: {test_command}
        Result: {PASS|FAIL}
        Error (if any): {error_message}
        Diagnosis: {PROGRESS|SPINNING|NEW_ERROR}
        Action: {what to do next based on classification}"

    4. ADJUST thresholds:
       IF self-test shows PROGRESS after rotation:
         → Reset stall_counter to 0
         → Reset spin_counter to 0 (new approach succeeded)

       IF self-test shows SPINNING despite rotation:
         → Double-increment spin_counter (+2 instead of +1)
         → This accelerates circuit break for approaches that
           look different but produce the same error
```

### Integration with Error Classification

```
The self-testing loop closes the gap between error classification and
approach rotation:

  BEFORE (v10.0):
    Error detected → Classify → Rotate approach → Hope it works

  AFTER (v10.1):
    Error detected → Classify → Rotate approach → Test → Classify result
                                                     ↓
                                           Feed back into next iteration

This prevents the "blind rotation" problem where the agent tries
a different approach but doesn't verify whether it actually fixed
anything before continuing.
```

### Skip Conditions

- Skip self-testing if no test runner is detected in the project
- Skip if the change is documentation-only (no testable code)
- Skip if circuit breaker state is TRIPPED (we're already stopping)
- Skip if `--skip-verify` flag is set (user opted out)

## Integration Points

### /fire-loop (primary consumer)

```markdown
# After Step 7 (Execute Task), before Step 8 (Iteration Tracking):

## Circuit Breaker Check
  cb_state = circuit_breaker.measure(
    files_changed = git_diff_stat(),
    error_output = last_error_if_any(),
    output_lines = count_lines(iteration_output)
  )

  IF cb_state == HEALTHY:
    continue normally

  IF cb_state == WARNING:
    display warning banner
    apply approach rotation
    continue with rotated approach

  IF cb_state == TRIPPED:
    display break banner
    save loop state
    trigger sabbath rest OR stop loop
```

### /fire-debug

```markdown
# After each debug cycle:

## Circuit Breaker Check
  Same measurement, but focused on same_error_hash threshold.
  Debug sessions are expected to have no file changes between
  diagnosis steps, so no_file_changes threshold is relaxed to 5/8.
```

### /fire-3-execute

```markdown
# Per-task monitoring during plan execution:

## Circuit Breaker (Lightweight)
  Only track same_error_hash at plan execution level.
  If same build/test error appears 3 times across tasks,
  pause execution and ask user.
```
