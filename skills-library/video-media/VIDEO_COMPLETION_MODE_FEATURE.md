# Video Completion Mode Feature

## Overview
This feature allows instructors to choose how students complete video lessons in their courses. Instructors can select between **Automatic Tracking** (requires 90% video watch time) or **Manual Completion** (students click to mark complete).

**Date Implemented**: 2025-10-20

## Features Implemented

### 1. Video Progress Indicator
**File**: [client/src/pages/CourseContent.jsx:582-614](client/src/pages/CourseContent.jsx#L582-L614)

A visual progress bar displays below each video showing:
- Current watch percentage (0-100%)
- Color-coded progress bar:
  - Yellow: 0-49% watched
  - Blue: 50-89% watched
  - Green: 90-100% watched
- Time watched (minutes:seconds format)
- "Ready to mark complete!" message when 90% threshold reached

**Visual Example**:
```
Your Progress                    92%
[████████████████████████████░░]
3:45 watched    Ready to mark complete!
```

### 2. Instructor Completion Mode Setting
**Files**:
- Frontend UI: [client/src/pages/teacher/CourseBuilder.jsx:972-1017](client/src/pages/teacher/CourseBuilder.jsx#L972-L1017)
- Backend Model: [server/models/Course.pg.js:111,159](server/models/Course.pg.js)
- Database Migration: [server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql](server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql)

Instructors can configure completion tracking in the **Settings** tab of CourseBuilder:

#### Automatic Tracking (Recommended - Default)
- Students must watch at least 90% of each video before marking it complete
- Prevents students from skipping ahead without watching content
- "Mark Complete & Continue" button is disabled until 90% threshold reached
- Tooltip shows current progress: "Watch at least 90% of the video to continue (X% watched)"

#### Manual Completion
- Students can mark any lesson complete at any time
- Useful for courses with optional content or self-paced learning
- "Mark Complete & Continue" button is always enabled
- Students have full control over their progress tracking

---

## Database Changes

### Migration File
**Location**: [server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql](server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql)

### Schema Changes
Added `completion_mode` column to `courses` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.courses
ADD COLUMN completion_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'automatic' NOT NULL
CHECK (completion_mode IN ('automatic', 'manual'));
```

**Field Details**:
- **Type**: TEXT
- **Default**: 'automatic'
- **Allowed Values**: 'automatic' | 'manual'
- **Constraint**: CHECK constraint ensures only valid values
- **Index**: `idx_courses_completion_mode` for query performance

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Mode (Default)
1. Student starts watching a video
2. Progress is tracked every 5 seconds (debounced)
3. When student reaches 90% watch time:
   - Database trigger automatically marks lesson as complete
   - Progress bar turns green
   - "Ready to mark complete!" message appears
   - "Mark Complete & Continue" button becomes enabled
4. Student can now proceed to next lesson

### Manual Mode
1. Student watches video (or not - their choice)
2. Progress is still tracked and displayed
3. "Mark Complete & Continue" button is always enabled
4. Student clicks button whenever they're ready
5. Lesson is marked complete regardless of watch percentage

---

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Logic
**File**: [client/src/pages/CourseContent.jsx:658-678](client/src/pages/CourseContent.jsx#L658-L678)

The "Mark Complete & Continue" button uses conditional logic:

```javascript
disabled={
  // Disabled if last lesson
  getAllLessons().findIndex(l => (l.id || l._id) === (activeLesson?.id || activeLesson?._id)) === getAllLessons().length - 1 ||
  // ALSO disabled if in automatic mode AND video lesson AND less than 90% watched
  (
    (course?.completion_mode || course?.completionMode) === 'automatic' &&
    (activeLesson?.contentType || activeLesson?.content_type) === 'video' &&
    (videoProgress?.completion_percentage || 0) < 90
  )
}
```

### Backend Field Mapping
**File**: [server/models/Course.pg.js:111,159](server/models/Course.pg.js)

Field mapping handles both camelCase (frontend) and snake_case (database):

```javascript
const fieldMapping = {
  // ... other fields ...
  completionMode: 'completion_mode'
};
```

This ensures:
- Frontend sends: `completionMode: 'automatic'`
- Database receives: `completion_mode: 'automatic'`
- Backend returns: `completion_mode: 'automatic'`
- Frontend reads both: `course.completionMode || course.completion_mode`

---

## User Experience

### For Instructors
1. Open CourseBuilder for any course
2. Navigate to **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to "Lesson Completion Tracking" section
4. Choose completion mode:
   - **Automatic Tracking (Recommended)**: Enforces 90% watch requirement
   - **Manual Completion**: Students have full control
5. Save course settings

### For Students

#### Automatic Mode
- Video progress bar shows real-time watch progress
- "Mark Complete & Continue" button is grayed out until 90% watched
- Hovering over disabled button shows: "Watch at least 90% of the video to continue (X% watched)"
- Once 90% reached, button becomes active and shows "Ready to mark complete!"
- Click button to complete lesson and move to next

#### Manual Mode
- Video progress bar still shows watch progress (for student awareness)
- "Mark Complete & Continue" button is always active
- Student can complete lesson at any time
- Student has freedom to skip content or revisit later

## Testing Checklist

### Database Migration
- [ ] Run migration: `psql -U postgres -d mern_lms -f server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql`
- [ ] Verify column exists: `\d courses` (should show `completion_mode` column)
- [ ] Verify default value: New courses should default to 'automatic'
- [ ] Verify constraint: Attempt to set invalid value (should fail)

### Frontend - CourseBuilder
- [ ] Open any course in CourseBuilder
- [ ] Navigate to Settings tab
- [ ] Verify completion mode radio buttons are visible
- [ ] Verify "Automatic Tracking" is selected by default
- [ ] Switch to "Manual Completion" and save
- [ ] Reload page - verify "Manual Completion" is still selected
- [ ] Switch back to "Automatic Tracking" and save

### Frontend - Student Course View
- [ ] As student, open a course with Automatic mode
- [ ] Start watching a video (less than 90%)
- [ ] Verify progress bar shows yellow/blue color
- [ ] Verify "Mark Complete & Continue" button is disabled
- [ ] Hover over button - should show tooltip with percentage
- [ ] Watch to 90%+ - button should become enabled
- [ ] Verify progress bar turns green
- [ ] Click button - should mark complete and advance to next lesson

- [ ] Open a course with Manual mode
- [ ] Start watching a video (any percentage)
- [ ] Verify "Mark Complete & Continue" button is always enabled
- [ ] Click button at any watch percentage
- [ ] Verify lesson is marked complete
- [ ] Verify can proceed to next lesson

### Backend API
- [ ] Create new course via API - verify defaults to 'automatic'
- [ ] Update course completion_mode to 'manual' - verify saves correctly
- [ ] Update course completion_mode to 'automatic' - verify saves correctly
- [ ] Attempt to set invalid value - should return validation error
- [ ] Verify field is included in GET /api/courses/:id response

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Using psql (Recommended)**
```bash
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f "C:\Users\YourName\source\repos\your-project\server\migrations\010_add_course_completion_mode.sql"
```

**Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `server/migrations/010_add_course_completion_mode.sql`
4. Paste and run

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check column exists
\d courses;

-- Verify default value
SELECT completion_mode FROM courses LIMIT 5;

-- Test constraint
UPDATE courses SET completion_mode = 'invalid'; -- Should fail
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend
1. Build client: `cd client && npm run build`
2. Open any course in CourseBuilder
3. Check Settings tab for completion mode options
4. Test both modes as a student

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
**Error**: `column "completion_mode" already exists`
**Solution**: Migration is idempotent - safe to run multiple times. The column already exists.

### Button Always Disabled
**Symptom**: "Mark Complete & Continue" button is always disabled even at 100% watch time
**Possible Causes**:
1. Course is in automatic mode but `completion_mode` field not returned from API
   - Check: Open browser DevTools → Network → Check course API response
   - Fix: Verify backend field mapping includes `completionMode`
2. Video progress not being tracked
   - Check: Open browser DevTools → Console → Look for progress update logs
   - Fix: Verify video `onTimeUpdate` handler is firing

### Button Always Enabled (Should Be Disabled)
**Symptom**: In automatic mode, button is enabled even at 0% watch time
**Possible Causes**:
1. Course `completion_mode` is 'manual' instead of 'automatic'
   - Check: Inspect `course` object in browser DevTools → Console
   - Fix: Update course in CourseBuilder Settings tab
2. Logic error in disabled condition
   - Check: Verify condition in [CourseContent.jsx:660-667](client/src/pages/CourseContent.jsx#L660-L667)

### Progress Bar Not Showing
**Symptom**: No progress indicator visible below video
**Possible Causes**:
1. `videoProgress` state is null/undefined
   - Check: Console log `videoProgress` state
   - Fix: Verify `loadVideoProgress()` is being called
2. Lesson is not a video type
   - Check: Progress bar only shows for video lessons
   - Fix: This is expected behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Configurable Threshold**: Allow instructors to set custom completion percentage (e.g., 75%, 85%, 95%)
2. **Per-Lesson Override**: Allow setting completion mode at individual lesson level instead of course-wide
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Show instructors which students are completing automatically vs manually
4. **Progress Milestones**: Display markers at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% on progress bar
5. **Completion Report**: Generate PDF report of student completion rates and watch times
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced progress indicator for smaller screens
7. **A/B Testing**: Compare student outcomes between automatic vs manual modes
