# PayPal Payment Testing Guide

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing
**Latest Fix:** Commit `9f7ec72` - Fixed PayPal order ID extraction
**Date:** November 6, 2025

---

## Bug Fixed

**Problem:** PayPal button was throwing "Expected an order id to be passed" error.

**Root Cause:** The `handleCreateOrder` callback was not properly extracting the PayPal order ID from the API response. The response structure is:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    paypal_order_id: "5N6478915C451273H"  // ← Order ID is nested in .data
  }
}
```

But the code was trying to access `paypalResponse.paypal_order_id` (not nested).

**Fix Applied:** Extract from correct path: `paypalResponse.data?.paypal_order_id`

**Commit:** `9f7ec72`

## Testing Prerequisites

You have TWO options for testing PayPal:

### Option 1: Sandbox Mode (Recommended for Development)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Use test accounts (no real money charged)
- ✅ Instant testing
- ✅ No PayPal account needed
- ✅ Repeatable testing

**Setup:**
1. Get sandbox credentials from [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Create a business test account
3. Create a buyer test account
4. Update `.env`:
   ```
   PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your_sandbox_client_id>
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_sandbox_secret>
   ```

### Option 2: Production Mode (Current Setup)

**Current Configuration:**
```
PAYPAL_MODE=live
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
```

**To Test in Production:**
- ✅ You DO NOT need to be logged into PayPal account
- ✅ PayPal will open a login popup during checkout
- ⚠️ Real money WILL be charged (use test transaction amounts like $1.00)
- ⚠️ Not recommended for initial testing

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Step 1: Browser & Environment Prep

```
1. Open fresh browser or incognito window (clears cache)
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 in use)
3. Open DevTools: Press F12
4. Go to Console tab
5. Keep console visible throughout testing
```

### Step 2: Browse Products & Add to Cart

```
1. Click "Shop" or navigate to /shop
2. Select a product
3. Click "Add to Cart"
4. Verify:
   - Cart count increments (top right)
   - Success toast appears ("Added to cart")
   - No errors in console
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Checkout

```
1. Click cart icon or navigate to /checkout
2. Verify:
   - Checkout page loads
   - Cart items display with prices
   - Billing address form visible
   - Payment method selector shows two options:
     ✓ Credit/Debit Card (Stripe)
     ✓ PayPal
```

### Step 4: Fill Billing Address (Required)

```
1. Fill in required fields:
   - Full Name: "John Doe" (or any name)
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Address Line 1: "123 Main St"
   - City: "New York"
   - State: "NY"
   - Postal Code: "10001"

3. Verify no validation errors
```

### Step 5: Select PayPal as Payment Method

```
1. Find "Payment Method" section
2. Click "PayPal" radio button
3. Verify:
   - Stripe card form DISAPPEARS
   - PayPal button container appears
   - Console shows: "✅ PayPal SDK script loaded"
```

### Step 6: Watch for PayPal Button Rendering

```
Wait 2-3 seconds and verify:
   ✅ "Loading PayPal..." spinner disappears
   ✅ Blue PayPal button appears
   ✅ Console shows no errors

Console should show:
   💳 Creating PayPal order for order ID: <uuid>
   ✅ PayPal order created: { success: true, data: {...} }
   📋 Returning PayPal Order ID: 5N6478915C451273H  ← This is KEY
   ✅ PayPal SDK script loaded
   🎯 Rendering PayPal buttons...
   ✅ PayPal buttons rendered successfully
```

### Step 7: Click PayPal Button

```
1. Click the blue PayPal button
2. Verify console output:
   💳 Creating PayPal order for order ID: <uuid>
   ✅ PayPal order created...
   📋 Returning PayPal Order ID: 5N6478915C451273H  ← Check this!

3. After 1-2 seconds, PayPal login popup should appear
```

### Step 8: Approve Payment on PayPal

```
If using Production Mode:
   1. Login popup opens
   2. Enter your PayPal credentials
   3. Review transaction ($1.00 or your amount)
   4. Click "Approve" or "Pay Now"

If using Sandbox Mode:
   1. Login popup opens
   2. Use test buyer account credentials
   3. Review transaction
   4. Click "Approve"
```

### Step 9: Return to Order Confirmation

```
After PayPal approval, you should automatically return to:
   URL: http://localhost:3000/orders/<order-id>/confirmation

Verify:
   ✅ Order confirmation page displays
   ✅ Order number shows
   ✅ Items listed
   ✅ Total amount correct
   ✅ Payment status: "Paid"
   ✅ Cart is empty (cleared after payment)
```

### Step 10: Verify in Console (No Errors)

```
Look for these successful logs:
   ✅ Order created: { id: "...", order_number: "...", status: "..." }
   ✅ PayPal SDK script loaded
   ✅ PayPal buttons rendered successfully
   💳 Creating PayPal order...
   📋 Returning PayPal Order ID: <id>
   ✅ PayPal order created
   ✅ PayPal approved, capturing payment...
   ✅ Payment captured: { success: true, ... }
   📝 Updating order payment status to paid...
   ✅ Order payment status updated to paid

Verify NO errors like:
   ❌ Expected an order id to be passed
   ❌ zoid destroyed all components
   ❌ Invalid hook call
   ❌ 404 errors
```

## What PayPal Order ID Looks Like

After your fix, the console should show:

```
✅ PayPal order created:
Object {
  success: true,
  data: {
    paypal_order_id: "5N6478915C451273H",
    status: "CREATED",
    links: [...]
  }
}

📋 Returning PayPal Order ID: 5N6478915C451273H
```

The `paypal_order_id` is what PayPal's button system expects. If this is `undefined`, PayPal throws "Expected an order id to be passed".

// 1. User fills address and clicks "Prepare PayPal Payment"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Expected an order id to be passed"

**This should now be FIXED** ✅

If you still see this error:
1. Check console for: `📋 Returning PayPal Order ID:`
2. If it shows `undefined` → order ID not extracted
3. If it shows a value like `5N6478...` → working correctly

**What this error means:** PayPal button's `createOrder` callback didn't return a valid order ID.

**Possible causes (now fixed):**
- ❌ Order ID was `paypalResponse.paypal_order_id` (undefined) - NOW FIXED
- ✅ Should be `paypalResponse.data.paypal_order_id` - IMPLEMENTED

### Issue: Button doesn't appear

**Check:**
1. Are you on checkout page? `/checkout`
2. Did you select PayPal payment method?
3. Did you fill in billing address?
4. Check console for: `✅ PayPal buttons rendered successfully`
5. If not, check for errors like:
   - "Failed to load PayPal SDK" → Network issue
   - "Failed to render PayPal buttons" → SDK issue

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Clear browser cache
- Check VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID in .env is set

### Issue: Button appears but click does nothing

**Check:**
1. PayPal SDK is loaded (check console)
2. Buttons rendered successfully (check console)
3. Order exists in database

**What might be happening:**
- Button still creating order (wait 2-3 seconds)
- Check console for errors when clicking

**Test:**
- Click button
- Check console immediately
- Look for: `💳 Creating PayPal order...`

### Issue: PayPal popup doesn't open

**Causes:**
1. Browser popup blocked → Allow popups from localhost
2. Order ID not extracted → Check `📋 Returning PayPal Order ID:`
3. Network error → Check Network tab in DevTools

**Fix popup blocking:**
- Firefox: Icon in address bar → Allow popups
- Chrome: Icon in address bar → Allow popups
- Edge: Icon in address bar → Allow popups

### Issue: Payment not captured (stuck on confirmation page)

**Check:**
1. Console shows: `✅ Payment captured` → Payment succeeded
2. Order status is "Paid" → Check database
3. Cart cleared → Check cart count goes to 0

**If stuck:**
1. Hard refresh `/checkout`
2. Check database for order status
3. Check if `paypal_order_id` stored correctly

## Sign In Requirements

### Do you need to be signed into PayPal?

**No, you DO NOT need to be pre-signed into PayPal.**

When user clicks PayPal button:
1. ✅ PopUp opens for PayPal login
2. ✅ User logs in during checkout (or uses remembered login)
3. ✅ User approves payment
4. ✅ Redirects back to your app

**You (the developer) DO NOT need to:**
- Be logged into PayPal
- Have a PayPal account signed in

**Test account requirements (Sandbox):**
- Business account (seller account)
- Buyer account (for testing purchases)
Both created in PayPal Developer Dashboard

**Production requirements:**
- Real PayPal Business account (if charging real money)
- For testing, use low amounts ($1.00)

## Database Verification

After successful PayPal payment, check database:

```sql
-- Check order was created
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE id = '<order_id_from_url>'
LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- payment_status: 'paid'
-- status: 'processing'
-- payment_method: 'paypal'
-- paypal_order_id: '5N6478915C451273H'
-- total_amount: '1.00'
```
