async function joinZoomMeeting(meetingId) {
  // Get signature from backend
  const response = await fetch(`/api/zoom/meetings/${meetingId}/join`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });

  const { data } = await response.json();

  // Configure Zoom

    isSupportAV: true,
    success: () => {
      ZoomMtg.join({
        signature: data.signature,
