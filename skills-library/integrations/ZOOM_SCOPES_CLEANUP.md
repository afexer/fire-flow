```

### Step 2: Click Your App
Find: "[Organization Name] LMS"

### Step 3: Go to Scopes Tab
Click "Scopes" in the left menu

### Step 4: Uncheck Unnecessary Scopes

**Process**:
1. Look through all enabled (checked) scopes
2. For each scope NOT in the "KEEP" list above

- Meeting Scopes → KEEP meeting:write and meeting:read, uncheck others
- Recording Scopes → KEEP recording:read, uncheck others
- Webinar → uncheck all (unless you use webinars)
- Chat → uncheck all
- Team Chat → uncheck all
- Events → uncheck all
- Dashboard → uncheck all (optional)

### Step 5: Final Check

After cleanup, you should have ONLY:
```
✅ meeting:write
✅ meeting:read
✅ user:read
✅ recording:read
```

## 🧪 Testing After Cleanup

Once cleaned up, test again:

```bash
cd server
node test-zoom-connection.js
