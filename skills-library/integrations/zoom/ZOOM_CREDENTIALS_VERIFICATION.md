# Zoom Credentials Verification Guide
**Status**: 🔴 Authentication Error - Needs Verification
**Date**: October 26, 2025

---

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Error**: `invalid_client` (HTTP 400)
- Credentials are found in .env ✅
- But Zoom API rejected them ❌

**Likely Cause**:
- Client ID or Client Secret is incorrect
- Credentials don't match the Account ID
- App not properly configured in Zoom Marketplace

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Your Zoom Credentials

### Step 1: Go to Zoom Marketplace
```
https://developers.zoom.us/marketplace
```

### Step 2: Select Your App
- Click on your app (should be called "[Organization Name] LMS" or similar)

### Step 3: Find "App Credentials" Tab
```
Click: "App Credentials" → "OAuth"
```

### Step 4: Verify You Have Server-to-Server OAuth
The credential type should say:
```
"Server-to-Server OAuth"
```

NOT:
- "OAuth 2.0"
- "JWT"
- Something else

## 📋 What to Copy

From the App Credentials page, you should see:

### Account ID
```
Format: Alphanumeric string with mixed case and numbers
Example: YOUR_ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID
Location: "Account ID" field
```

### Client ID
```
Format: Alphanumeric (usually 20+ characters)
Example: YOUR_ZOOM_S2S_CLIENT_ID
Location: "Client ID" field
```

### Client Secret
```
Format: Long alphanumeric string
Example: YOUR_ZOOM_S2S_CLIENT_SECRET
Location: "Client Secret" field
⚠️ NOTE: This is sensitive - treat like a password!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "invalid_client" Error
**Meaning**: Zoom rejected the credentials

**Fix Options**:
1. **Re-copy credentials** - Make sure you copied exactly (no extra spaces)
2. **Check App Status** - Verify app is "Active" (not disabled)
3. **Verify Account ID** - Make sure it's the ACCOUNT ID, not a USER ID
4. **Create New Credentials** - In Zoom dashboard:
   - Click "Generate" to create new Client ID/Secret
   - Copy the new values to .env

### Issue 2: Credentials Don't Match
**Signs**:
- You have multiple Zoom apps
- Not sure which credentials belong to which app

**Solution**:
```
Go to Zoom Marketplace:
1. Click each app
2. Check "App Credentials" tab
3. Note which is Server-to-Server OAuth
4. Copy credentials for that app
```

### Issue 3: App Not Active
**Fix**:
```
In Zoom Marketplace:
1. Go to your app
2. Check if status shows "Active"
3. If disabled, click "Activate"
4. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
```

## 📝 Current .env Values

Your current .env has:
```env
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ZOOM_CLIENT_ID
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET
```

**⚠️ Note**: Your Account ID and Client Secret have the same value. This is unusual and might be a copy-paste error.

## ✅ How to Test After Fixing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd server
node test-zoom-connection.js
```

**Expected Output** (if successful):
```
✅ Access token obtained successfully
✅ API Access Verified!

📌 Account Information:
   User ID: ...
   Email: ...
   Name: ...
```
