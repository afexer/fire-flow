## 🎯 What You Need To Do NOW

```
https://developers.zoom.us/marketplace
```

### Step 2: Find Your App
- Look for: "[Organization Name] LMS"
- Click on it

### Step 3: Enable Required Scopes
Go to the **Scopes** section and **ENABLE** (check) these 4 scopes:

#### ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - Must Have These:
```
☑️ meeting:write     (Create/update/delete meetings)
☑️ meeting:read      (View meeting details)
☑️ user:read        (Verify account setup)
```

#### ⭐⭐ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:
```
☑️ recording:read    (Access meeting recordings)
```

#### ⚪ Optional (You can skip these):
```
☐ webinar:write     (Only if you want webinars)
☐ webinar:read      (Only if you want webinars)
☐ cloud_recording:read (Only for advanced recording analytics)
☐ report:read       (Only for admin analytics)
```

### Step 4: Save Configuration
- Click the **Save** button
- Wait for confirmation message

### Step 5: Verify Scopes Were Saved
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check that the 4 scopes are still enabled
- You should NOT see any error messages

---

## 🧪 Test After Enabling Scopes

Once scopes are enabled, run this test:

```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\source\repos\your-project\server
node test-zoom-connection.js
```

### Expected Result (if successful):
```
✅ ✅ ✅ All Tests Passed! ✅ ✅ ✅

🎉 Your Zoom API is fully configured and working!
```

### If test still fails:
- Go back to Step 3 and verify all 4 scopes are checked
- Make sure you clicked "Save"
- Wait 5 minutes and try again
- Zoom sometimes takes a moment to sync changes
