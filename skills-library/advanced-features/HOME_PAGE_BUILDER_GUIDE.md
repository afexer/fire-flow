## 📋 Component Mapping

Here's exactly which components to drag from the sidebar for each section:

---

## 1️⃣ Hero Section

**Component to Use:** `Hero`

**Configuration:**
```
Title: Grow in Faith
Subtitle: Through Biblical Teaching
Description: Join our community of believers in a journey of spiritual growth through authentic biblical teaching, transformative courses, and meaningful connections.

Primary Button:
  - Text: "Explore Courses"
  - Link: /courses
  - Style: Primary (dark background)

Secondary Button:
  - Text: "Learn More"
  - Link: /about
  - Style: Secondary (white background with border)
```

**Layout:** Full width, centered text

---

## 2️⃣ Spacer

**Component to Use:** `Spacer`

**Configuration:**
```
Height: Medium (or 64px)
```

This adds space between Hero and Stats sections.

---

## 3️⃣ Stats Section

**Problem:** There's no "Stats" component in your builder!

**Solution - Option 1:** Use `Text` component with custom HTML
**Solution - Option 2:** Skip this for now and ask developer to add a Stats component

**Temporary Workaround:**
1. Drag `Heading` component
2. Set text to: "500+ Active Members | 50+ Courses Available | 99% Satisfaction Rate | 24/7 Support"
3. Center align

**OR Skip this section** - It's nice to have but not critical

---

## 4️⃣ Features Section ("Why Choose Our Ministry")

**Component to Use:** `FeaturesGrid`

**Configuration:**
```
Section Heading: Why Choose Our Ministry
Section Description: Our ministry is committed to providing authentic biblical teaching that empowers believers to grow in their faith and understanding of Scripture.

---

## 5️⃣ Spacer

**Component to Use:** `Spacer`

**Configuration:**
```
Height: Medium
```

---

## 6️⃣ Featured Courses Section

**Problem:** No "Featured Courses" component exists!

**Solution:** This section is DYNAMIC (pulls from database) - you have 3 options:

### Option A: Skip It (Recommended for now)
- The hardcoded version shows this automatically
- Wait for developer to add this component to page builder

### Option B: Add Static Text
1. Drag `Heading` component
2. Text: "Featured Courses"
3. Center align
4. Drag `Text` component
5. Add message: "Visit our Courses page to explore our catalog"
6. Drag `CTA` component
7. Button text: "View All Courses"
8. Link: /courses

### Option C: Request Custom Component
- Ask developer to create a "FeaturedCourses" component for Puck

**My Recommendation:** Use Option B (static heading + CTA button)

---

## 7️⃣ Spacer

**Component to Use:** `Spacer`

**Configuration:**
```
Height: Large (or 96px)
```
