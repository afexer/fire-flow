# Church LMS Installer - Implementation Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026
**Status:** PLANNING PHASE
**Priority:** HIGH - Next major feature after current branch

---

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

The Church LMS Installer is a web-based installation wizard designed to make deploying the Community LMS accessible to non-technical users, specifically targeting pastors and church administrators. The system will transform the current MongoDB-only MERN stack into a portable, self-installable application supporting both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases commonly available on budget hosting providers.

### Vision Statement

> Enable any church administrator to deploy a fully-functional LMS on their existing cPanel hosting account in under 15 minutes, without requiring technical expertise or expensive infrastructure.

### Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Non-technical users can complete installation without developer assistance
2. **Affordability**: Works on shared hosting ($5-15/month) commonly used by churches
3. **Reliability**: 95%+ installation success rate across major hosting providers
4. **Flexibility**: Support both PostgreSQL and MySQL to maximize hosting compatibility
5. **Sustainability**: License-based model to fund ongoing development and support

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Installation Success Rate | > 95% | Analytics tracking on installer completion |
| Average Install Time | < 15 minutes | Timer from start to first login |
| Support Tickets per Install | < 0.5 | Support system tracking |
| Time to First Course Created | < 30 minutes | User activity tracking |
| cPanel Host Compatibility | Top 10 hosts | Manual testing certification |

| cPanel compatibility issues | Medium | High | Test on multiple hosts early in Phase 1; maintain compatibility matrix |
| Database abstraction complexity | High | Medium | Start with proven Knex.js; incremental migration; extensive testing |
| Node.js not available on hosts | Medium | High | Document minimum requirements clearly; provide VPS alternative path |
| MySQL feature gaps (vs PostgreSQL) | Medium | Medium | Identify critical JSONB usage early; design around limitations |
| License server downtime | Low | High | Offline grace period; caching; redundancy |
| Installation taking too long | Medium | Medium | Async operations; progress feedback; skip optional steps |
| Support ticket overload at launch | High | Medium | Extensive documentation; beta testing; staggered launch |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Security audit before launch; regular penetration testing |
| User abandons mid-install | Medium | Medium | Save progress; resume capability; email follow-up |
| Hosting provider blocks installer | Low | High | Test detection/blocking; provide manual alternative |

### Risk Response Plan

**If cPanel Compatibility Fails:**
1. Pivot to Docker-first approach
2. Partner with specific hosting providers
3. Offer managed installation service

**If Database Abstraction Proves Too Complex:**
1. Ship PostgreSQL-only first
2. MySQL support as Phase 6
3. Focus on hosts with PostgreSQL (SiteGround, A2, etc.)

**If Launch Support Is Overwhelming:**
1. Pause public launch
2. Implement automated troubleshooting
3. Create video tutorials for common issues

## Appendix A: Existing System Analysis

### Current Database Usage (PostgreSQL via postgres.js)

Key patterns that need abstraction:
- Tagged template literals: `` sql`SELECT * FROM courses` ``
- JSONB columns for flexible data
- Array types for tags/categories
- UUID primary keys
- Timestamp with timezone

### Migration Complexity Assessment

| Table | Complexity | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| profiles | Low | Standard columns |
| courses | Medium | JSONB settings column |
| lessons | Medium | Content as JSONB |
| assessments | High | Complex question structure |
| payments | Low | Standard payment fields |
| certificates | Low | Standard fields |
| *43 tables total* | | |

### Estimated JSONB Usage

- Course settings: 5 tables
- Lesson content: 3 tables
- Assessment questions: 2 tables
- User preferences: 1 table

**Migration Strategy:** Convert JSONB to TEXT/JSON with application-level parsing where native support unavailable.
