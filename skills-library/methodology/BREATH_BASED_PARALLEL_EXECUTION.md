# Breath-Based Parallel Execution - Implementation Guide

## The Problem

When executing multi-plan phases, sequential execution wastes time. Independent plans could run in parallel, but coordination is complex and dependencies must be respected.

### Why It Was Hard

- **Dependency management:** Plans may depend on earlier plan outputs
- **Resource conflicts:** Parallel operations might conflict (same files, ports)
- **Coordination overhead:** Multiple agents need synchronized context
- **Error propagation:** One failure could block dependent plans
- **Documentation fragmentation:** Each agent creates separate summaries

### Impact

- Sequential execution: 105-145 minutes estimated for Phase 1
- Wasted developer time waiting for independent tasks
- Delayed feedback on errors in parallel-capable plans
- Inefficient use of compute resources

---

## The Solution

**Breath-Based Parallel Execution** groups plans by dependency level into "breaths." Plans in the same breath execute in parallel, while breath N+1 waits for breath N completion.

### Architecture

```
Breath Structure:
  Breath 1 (Sequential - Foundation):
    └─ Plan X-01: Core infrastructure

  Breath 2 (Parallel - Both depend only on Breath 1):
    ├─ Plan X-02: Database setup
    └─ Plan X-03: Storage setup

  Breath 3 (Parallel - Depend on Breath 2):
    ├─ Plan X-04: Feature A (needs DB + Storage)
    └─ Plan X-05: Feature B (needs DB + Storage)
```

### Key Concepts

**1. Breath Grouping Rules:**
- Plans with NO dependencies → Breath 1
- Plans depending ONLY on Breath 1 → Breath 2
- Plans depending on Breath 2 → Breath 3
- All plans in a breath can run simultaneously

**2. Execution Flow:**
```
Start Phase Execution
  ↓
Discover all plans in phase
  ↓
Group plans by dependency level (breaths)
  ↓
For each breath:
  - Spawn fire-executor agent per plan (parallel)
  - Each agent creates RECORD.md independently
  - Wait for ALL agents in breath to complete
  - Check for blocking errors
  ↓
After all breaths complete:
  - Spawn fire-verifier agent
  - Validate must-haves across all plans
  - Update CONSCIENCE.md and SKILLS-INDEX.md
  ↓
Phase Complete
```

**3. Agent Coordination:**
- Each `fire-executor` receives:
  - Plan file context
  - Skills library access
  - Honesty protocols
  - Independent work scope
- Agents DO NOT communicate during execution
- Coordination happens at breath boundaries

## Implementation

### Step 1: Plan Discovery

```bash
# Scan for all plans in phase
.planning/phases/{N}-{name}/{N}-*-BLUEPRINT.md

# Example for Phase 1:
# - 1-01-BLUEPRINT.md
# - 1-02-BLUEPRINT.md
# - 1-03-BLUEPRINT.md
```

### Step 2: Breath Grouping

Read each plan's frontmatter:
```markdown
---
Phase: 1-setup
Plan: 02
Breath: 2
Depends On: ["1-01"]
---
```

Build dependency graph:
```javascript
const plans = [
  { id: "1-01", breath: 1, depends: [] },
  { id: "1-02", breath: 2, depends: ["1-01"] },
  { id: "1-03", breath: 2, depends: ["1-01"] }
];

const breaths = {
  1: ["1-01"],
  2: ["1-02", "1-03"]  // Can run in parallel
};
```

### Step 3: Spawn Executors Per Breath

**Breath 1 (Sequential):**
```typescript
// Single agent for foundation plan
await spawnExecutor({
  plan: "1-01",
  context: planFileContent,
  skills: relevantSkills,
  mode: "autonomous"
});
```

**Breath 2 (Parallel):**
```typescript
// Spawn multiple agents simultaneously
const executors = await Promise.all([
  spawnExecutor({
    plan: "1-02",
    context: plan1_02Content,
    skills: databaseSkills,
    mode: "autonomous"
  }),
  spawnExecutor({
    plan: "1-03",
    context: plan1_03Content,
    skills: storageSkills,
    mode: "autonomous"
  })
]);
```

### Step 4: Agent Execution Protocol

Each `fire-executor` agent:

**Input:**
```markdown
<plan_context>
@.planning/phases/{N}-{name}/{N}-{NN}-BLUEPRINT.md
</plan_context>

<skills_context>
Skills to apply:
@skills-library/{category}/{skill-1}.md
@skills-library/{category}/{skill-2}.md
</skills_context>

<execution_mode>
Mode: autonomous
User approval: pre-approved (YOLO mode)
</execution_mode>
```

**Process:**
1. Read plan file
2. Execute all tasks sequentially
3. Run verification commands
4. Apply honesty protocols
5. Create RECORD.md

**Output:**
- Implementation commits (atomic)
- `{N}-{NN}-RECORD.md` (fire-handoff format)
- SKILLS-INDEX.md updates

### Step 5: Breath Completion Check

```typescript
// Wait for all agents in breath to finish
await Promise.all(waveExecutors);

// Check for blocking errors
const blockingErrors = waveExecutors
  .filter(e => e.status === "blocked")
  .map(e => e.error);

if (blockingErrors.length > 0) {
  // Create .continue-here.md
  // Pause execution
  // Report to user
}
```

### Step 6: Verification

After all breaths complete:
```typescript
await spawnVerifier({
  phase: N,
  plans: allPlansInPhase,
  mustHaves: aggregatedMustHaves,
  validationChecklist: warriorChecklist
});
```

## Real-World Example: Phase 1 Execution

### Planning Context

**Phase 1 Plans:**
- Plan 1-01: Initialize Monorepo (Breath 1)
  - Depends: None
  - Time: 45-60 min estimate
- Plan 1-02: PostgreSQL + Prisma (Breath 2)
  - Depends: 1-01
  - Time: 30-45 min estimate
- Plan 1-03: MinIO + S3 Client (Breath 2)
  - Depends: 1-01
  - Time: 30-40 min estimate

**Sequential Estimate:** 105-145 minutes
**Parallel Potential:** Breath 2 can run simultaneously

### Execution Flow

**Breath 1: Foundation**
```bash
# Spawn single executor
fire-executor: Plan 1-01 (Initialize Monorepo)
  - Duration: 15.5 minutes (3x faster than estimate)
  - Output: 7 commits, 1-01-RECORD.md
  - Status: ✅ Complete
```

**Breath 2: Parallel Infrastructure**
```bash
# Spawn two executors simultaneously
fire-executor: Plan 1-02 (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
  - Duration: 15.4 minutes (2x faster than estimate)
  - Output: 8 commits, 1-02-RECORD.md
  - Status: ✅ Complete

fire-executor: Plan 1-03 (MinIO + S3)
  - Duration: 42 minutes
  - Output: 8 commits, 1-03-RECORD.md
  - Status: ✅ Complete (MinIO installation pending)

# Breath 2 completes in ~42 minutes (longest agent)
# Sequential would have been 15.4 + 42 = 57.4 minutes
# Savings: 15.4 minutes (27% faster)
```

**Final Verification:**
```bash
fire-verifier: Phase 1 Validation
  - Must-haves: 27/30 verified (3 pending MinIO install)
  - WARRIOR checks: Passed
  - Output: 1-VERIFICATION.md (if verification agent used)
```

### Results

**Total Time:** ~73 minutes
- Breath 1: 15.5 minutes
- Breath 2: 42 minutes (parallel)
- Verification: ~15 minutes (included in agent time)

**vs Sequential:** 105-145 minutes estimated
**Time Savings:** 32-72 minutes (31-50% faster)

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Breath 1: 3x faster than estimate
- Breath 2: 27% faster through parallelization
- Overall: 45% faster than estimated

## Agent Spawning Code

### Fire Executor Spawn

```typescript
async function spawnExecutor(plan: Plan): Promise<ExecutorResult> {
  return await Task({
    subagent_type: "fire-executor",
    description: `Execute ${plan.id}: ${plan.name}`,
    prompt: `
You are a fire-executor agent. Execute ${plan.id} with full autonomy.

**Context:**
- Phase: ${plan.phase}
- Plan: ${plan.id} - ${plan.name}
- Breath: ${plan.breath}
- User has approved all edits (YOLO mode)

**Plan File:**
@${plan.filePath}

**Instructions:**
1. Execute ALL tasks in the plan sequentially
2. Run ALL verification commands
3. Apply honesty protocols
4. Create summary: .planning/phases/${plan.phase}/${plan.id}-RECORD.md
5. Update SKILLS-INDEX.md

**Execution Mode:** Full autonomy, proceed with confidence.

Go ahead and execute the entire plan now.
    `,
    mode: "dontAsk"
  });
}
```

### Parallel Breath Execution

```typescript
// Claude Code: Use single message with multiple Task calls
async function executeWave(breath: number, plans: Plan[]) {
  console.log(`━━━ FIRE ► BREATH ${breath} EXECUTION ━━━`);

  // Spawn all executors in parallel
  const executors = plans.map(plan => spawnExecutor(plan));

  // Wait for all to complete
  const results = await Promise.all(executors);

  // Check for errors
  const errors = results.filter(r => r.status === "error");
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    throw new WaveExecutionError(breath, errors);
  }

  console.log(`✓ Breath ${breath} complete`);
  return results;
}
```

---

## Testing the Pattern

### Before (Sequential)
```
Plan 1-01: 15 min
  ↓ (wait)
Plan 1-02: 15 min
  ↓ (wait)
Plan 1-03: 42 min
  ↓
Total: 72 minutes
```

### After (Breath-Based)
```
Plan 1-01: 15 min
  ↓ (wait)
Plan 1-02: 15 min ┐ (parallel)
Plan 1-03: 42 min ┘
  ↓
Total: 57 minutes
Savings: 15 minutes (21%)
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Dependency Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Verify plans don't conflict
   - Check file modifications (no overlap)
   - Check port usage (no conflicts)
   - Check database operations (no race conditions)
   ```

2. **Execution Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Watch agent progress
   ◆ Breath 2 in progress...
     ├─ ⚡ Plan 1-02: Running (database)
     └─ ⚡ Plan 1-03: Running (storage)
   ```

3. **Completion Verification:**
   ```bash
   # All summaries created
   ls .planning/phases/1-setup/*-RECORD.md
   # Expected: 1-01-RECORD.md, 1-02-RECORD.md, 1-03-RECORD.md
   ```

## Prevention & Best Practices

### Breath Grouping Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Group truly independent plans together
- ✅ Check for file conflicts (Git will catch these)
- ✅ Document dependencies in plan frontmatter
- ✅ Test with small plans first

**Don't:**
- ❌ Put dependent plans in same breath
- ❌ Assume parallelization always faster (overhead exists)
- ❌ Ignore resource limits (disk I/O, memory)
- ❌ Skip breath completion checks

### Dependency Analysis

```markdown
# Plan Frontmatter Pattern
---
Phase: X-name
Plan: NN
Breath: N
Depends On: ["X-01", "X-02"]  # Must be in earlier breaths
Autonomous: true
Estimated Time: X-Y minutes
---
```

**Rules:**
1. Breath N can only depend on plans in breaths < N
2. Plans in same breath CANNOT depend on each other
3. If circular dependency detected → sequential execution

### Error Handling

**Blocking Error in Breath:**
```typescript
if (plan.status === "blocked") {
  // Create recovery document
  await createContinueHere({
    phase: plan.phase,
    plan: plan.id,
    blocker: plan.error,
    resumeInstructions: plan.recoverySteps
  });

  // Continue other plans in breath
  // Report blocker at breath completion
}
```

**Non-Blocking Error:**
```typescript
if (plan.status === "warning") {
  // Document in RECORD.md
  // Continue execution
  // Report in verification
}
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Incorrect Breath Assignment
❌ **Wrong:**
```yaml
Plan 2-01: Breath 1
Plan 2-02: Breath 2, Depends: ["2-01"]
Plan 2-03: Breath 2, Depends: ["2-02"]  # BAD: Depends on same breath
```

✅ **Correct:**
```yaml
Plan 2-01: Breath 1
Plan 2-02: Breath 2, Depends: ["2-01"]
Plan 2-03: Breath 3, Depends: ["2-02"]  # Good: Depends on earlier breath
```

### Mistake 2: Assuming All Parallelization Helps
❌ **Wrong:** "More parallel = faster"

✅ **Correct:** Consider overhead:
- Agent spawn time: ~2-5 seconds per agent
- Context loading: ~5-10 seconds per agent
- Git conflicts: Serial resolution needed
- Break-even: ~15+ minute tasks benefit most

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Resource Conflicts
❌ **Wrong:** Parallel plans modifying same file

✅ **Correct:** Check for conflicts:
```bash
# Plan 1: Modifies server/src/index.ts
# Plan 2: Also modifies server/src/index.ts
# → Git conflict → Sequential execution better
```

### Mistake 4: No Breath Completion Check
❌ **Wrong:** Start Breath 3 before Breath 2 done

✅ **Correct:** Always wait:
```typescript
await Promise.all(wave2Executors);
// Only then start Breath 3
await executeWave(3, wave3Plans);
```

---

## Time to Implement

**Setup Time:** 5-10 minutes (plan breath assignment)
**Execution Time:** Depends on longest plan in breath
**Verification Time:** 5-15 minutes

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- 2 plans, 15 min each: Sequential = 30 min, Parallel = ~20 min (saves 10 min)
- 3 plans, 30 min each: Sequential = 90 min, Parallel = ~35 min (saves 55 min)
- Overhead: ~5-10 min per parallel breath

**When to Use Parallel:**
- Plans > 15 minutes each
- No file/resource conflicts
- True independence (no hidden dependencies)

**When to Use Sequential:**
- Plans < 10 minutes each
- File conflicts likely
- Dependent operations
- Debugging needed

---

## Difficulty Level

⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Moderate

**Why 3 stars:**
- ✅ Easy: Spawn parallel agents (Promise.all)
- ⚠️ Medium: Dependency analysis
- ⚠️ Medium: Breath grouping decisions
- ⚠️ Hard: Error handling across breaths
- ⚠️ Hard: Documentation aggregation

**Skills Required:**
- Understanding of async/await and promises
- Dependency graph analysis
- Git conflict awareness
- Dominion Flow methodology knowledge

---

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Measure These

**Time Savings:**
```
Sequential Time: Sum of all plan estimates
Parallel Time: Sum of longest plan per breath
Savings: (Sequential - Parallel) / Sequential * 100%
```

**Efficiency Ratio:**
```
Ideal Parallel: Longest plan time
Actual Parallel: Real execution time
Efficiency: Ideal / Actual * 100%
```

**Example (Phase 1):**
- Sequential: 105 minutes
- Parallel: 73 minutes
- Savings: 30%
- Efficiency: 58/73 = 79% (good, overhead is 21%)

### Success Indicators

✅ **Success:**
- Time savings > 20%
- All plans complete successfully
- No Git conflicts
- Documentation complete
- Verification passes

⚠️ **Review Needed:**
- Time savings < 10%
- Frequent Git conflicts
- Agent failures in breath
- Overhead > 30%

❌ **Use Sequential:**
- Time savings negative
- Consistent failures
- Complex dependencies
- Small tasks (< 10 min)

## Author Notes

**Real-World Results (Phase 1 Execution):**
- Breath 1: 15.5 minutes (foundation)
- Breath 2: 42 minutes (parallel DB + Storage)
- Total: 73 minutes vs 105-145 min estimate
- Savings: 45% faster than expected

**Key Insights:**
1. **Parallelization overhead is real but acceptable** (~5-10 min)
2. **Individual agent efficiency mattered more** (3x faster tasks)
3. **Documentation aggregation is manual** (each agent creates RECORD.md)
4. **Git handles conflicts well** (no collisions in Phase 1)
5. **User feedback is delayed** (wait for breath completion)

**When I'd Use This Again:**
- ✅ Multi-infrastructure setup (DB + Storage + Cache)
- ✅ Independent feature development (Feature A + B + C)
- ✅ Parallel testing (Unit + Integration + E2E)
- ✅ Documentation generation (Multiple doc types)

**When I'd Avoid:**
- ❌ Single complex plan (no parallelization benefit)
- ❌ Sequential migrations (order matters)
- ❌ Debugging sessions (need sequential feedback)
- ❌ Small tasks < 10 min each (overhead > benefit)

**Best Use Case:**
Large phases with 3+ truly independent plans, each taking 20+ minutes. Phase 1 was perfect: monorepo setup (required), then parallel DB + Storage (independent infrastructure).
