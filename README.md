# Dominion Flow

**A comprehensive orchestration platform that empowers your Claude agent.**

Dominion Flow gives Claude a complete, structured way to take your project from idea to finished code — with built-in quality checks, session memory, parallel execution, and a library of proven patterns. Think of it as a project management system that lives inside Claude Code.

---

## What Does It Do?

When you start a new project, Claude normally has no memory between sessions, no standard process, and no way to verify its own work. Dominion Flow fixes all of that:

- **Structured workflow** — A numbered pipeline (Plan → Execute → Verify → Handoff) so nothing gets skipped
- **Session memory** — Claude picks up exactly where it left off, every time
- **Parallel execution** — Multiple tasks run at the same time, safely, so work gets done faster
- **Built-in quality gates** — A comprehensive checklist verifies every phase before moving on
- **Skills library** — A growing collection of proven code patterns Claude can reuse instead of reinventing every time

---

## Who Is This For?

This plugin is for anyone using Claude Code who wants:
- Consistent, repeatable results on complex projects
- Claude to remember what it was doing between sessions
- Code that gets reviewed and verified, not just written

**No prior experience with orchestration or AI agents required.**



Introducing Dominion Flow: Elevate Your Claude Code Workflow

Are you using Claude Code to build projects but feeling limited by session-hopping, lack of structure, or the need to constantly re-explain your requirements? Dominion Flow is a project management and orchestration plugin built to transform Claude from a simple assistant into a structured, persistent, and highly capable autonomous development agent.
What is Dominion Flow?

Dominion Flow acts as a professional-grade "operating system" inside your terminal. It introduces a formal, repeatable pipeline—Plan → Execute → Verify → Handoff—that ensures your project moves from an idea to working, verified code without skipping critical steps.
Why Use It?

    Persistent Memory: Through integrated vector database support (Qdrant), Dominion Flow allows Claude to remember your codebase, past decisions, and coding patterns across different sessions.

    Structured Pipeline: Stop guessing where to start. The platform uses a clear, 51-command framework to guide you through every phase of development.

    Quality & Verification: Built-in quality gates and automated testing (including Playwright E2E testing) ensure that code isn't just written—it's verified.

    Autonomous Capabilities: Need to go hands-off? Features like /fire-autonomous allow Claude to plan, code, and verify entire project phases on its own.

    Reusable Skills Library: Stop reinventing the wheel. Dominion Flow includes a library of proven, reusable patterns for authentication, APIs, payments, and more, which Claude can automatically learn and store as you build.

Who Is It For?

Whether you are a developer looking for a consistent, professional workflow or someone who wants to maximize the potential of Claude Code, Dominion Flow provides the structure and "long-term memory" required for complex, real-world projects.
How to Get Started

Dominion Flow is designed to be easily installed as a Claude Code plugin. Simply clone the repository and run the installation command:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/ThierryN/fire-flow.git
claude install-plugin ./fire-flow

For advanced users, the repository also supports optional "Power Features" like Docker-integrated memory (Qdrant) and local embeddings (Ollama) to make the agent even more powerful.

## Quick Install

**Prerequisite:** You need [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) installed first. If you don't have it yet, download and install it, then come back here.

Choose either Method A (recommended) or Method B:

---

### Method A — Git Clone (Recommended)

1. Open your terminal and clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThierryN/fire-flow.git
   ```

2. Install the plugin from the cloned folder:
   ```bash
   claude install-plugin ./fire-flow
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code

4. Type `/fire-0-orient` to check that everything is working

---

### Method B — Download ZIP (No Git Required)

1. Go to [github.com/ThierryN/fire-flow](https://github.com/ThierryN/fire-flow)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button → **"Download ZIP"**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder you will keep (e.g., `Documents/fire-flow`)
4. Open your terminal and install the plugin from that folder:

   **Mac / Linux:**
   ```bash
   claude install-plugin ~/Documents/fire-flow
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   claude install-plugin C:\Users\YourName\Documents\fire-flow
   ```
   *(Replace `YourName` with your actual Windows username)*

5. Restart Claude Code

6. Type `/fire-0-orient` to check that everything is working

---

## Optional but Recommended: Power Features

The core workflow works out of the box. These extras unlock **persistent memory**, **codebase search**, and **Docker Hub access** — features that make Claude dramatically more capable on larger projects.

---

### Step 1 — Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is required to run Qdrant. Install it before anything else.

**Windows (PC):**

1. Go to [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and click **Download for Windows**
2. Before running the installer, open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --update
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```
3. Restart your computer
4. Run the Docker installer and choose **"Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V"** when prompted
5. After install, open Docker Desktop from your Start menu and wait for it to fully start (the whale icon in your taskbar stops animating)
6. Verify it worked:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

**Mac:**

1. Go to [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and click **Download for Mac**
   - Choose **Apple Chip** if you have an M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac, or **Intel Chip** for older Macs
   - Not sure which? Click Apple menu → **About This Mac**
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Open Docker from Applications and follow the prompts
4. Wait for it to fully start (whale icon in menu bar stops animating)
5. Verify it worked:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

> Docker Desktop must be **open and running** whenever you use Qdrant or hub-mcp.

---

### Step 2 — Run Qdrant (Vector Database)

Qdrant stores Claude's persistent memory across sessions — so Claude remembers your codebase, past decisions, and patterns from previous work.

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 6333:6333 \
  -p 6334:6334 \
  -v qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
  --name qdrant \
  qdrant/qdrant
```

| Port | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **6333** | REST API — main port used by Claude |
| **6334** | gRPC — high-speed operations |

**Verify:** Open [http://localhost:6333/dashboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard) in your browser. If you see the Qdrant dashboard, it is running.

---

### Step 3 — Connect Qdrant to Claude (MCP)

This is what allows Claude to read and write to your `power_flow_memory` database.

**Mac or WSL:**
```bash
claude mcp add qdrant -s user -- uvx mcp-server-qdrant \
  --url http://localhost:6333 \
  --collection-name power_flow_memory
```

**Windows (CMD or PowerShell):**
```bash
claude mcp add qdrant -s user -- cmd /c uvx mcp-server-qdrant \
  --url http://localhost:6333 \
  --collection-name power_flow_memory
```

---

### Step 4 — Install Ollama (Local Embeddings)

Ollama runs locally and generates the vectors that get stored in Qdrant.

1. Download and install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull the embedding model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

---

### Step 5 — Run Docker Hub MCP Server (hub-mcp)

hub-mcp lets Claude search Docker Hub, browse images and tags, and pull images by just asking.

```bash
docker pull docker/hub-mcp
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name hub-mcp \
  docker/hub-mcp
```

Connect to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add hub-docker -s user --transport sse http://localhost:8080/sse
```

> If port 8080 is already in use on your machine, change the left port number (e.g., `-p 9090:8080`) and update the URL to match (e.g., `http://localhost:9090/sse`).

---

### Verify Everything Is Connected

Restart Claude Code, then type `/mcp`. You should see:

| Server | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `qdrant` | Claude ↔ `power_flow_memory` database |
| `hub-docker` | Claude ↔ Docker Hub image search |

Then ask Claude to confirm the database connection:

> *"Check if my Qdrant power_flow_memory collection is reachable and tell me how many points are stored."*

Claude will query Qdrant directly and confirm it is live.

---

## Your First Project (5 Minutes)

Start a new project with one command:

```bash
/fire-1a-new
```

Claude will ask you a few simple questions about your project, then set everything up automatically. After that, the numbered commands walk you through each step:

```
/fire-1a-new      → Start your project (asks you questions, creates the plan)
/fire-2-plan 1   → Plan the first phase of work
/fire-3-execute 1 → Build it (Claude does the coding)
/fire-4-verify 1  → Check that everything actually works
/fire-5-handoff   → Save your progress before closing
/fire-6-resume    → Pick up where you left off next session
```

**Want Claude to handle everything automatically?**
After `/fire-1a-new`, just run:
```bash
/fire-autonomous
```
Claude will plan, build, and verify every phase without you having to type each command.

## Finding More Skills

The skills library is what makes Dominion Flow powerful. Skills are reusable patterns that Claude draws on during your project — for auth, payments, APIs, database design, testing, and much more.

**Where to find skills:**

- [aitmpl.com/skills](https://www.aitmpl.com/skills) — Curated skill collections, ready to install
- [skillsmp.com](https://skillsmp.com/) — Community skill marketplace
- GitHub — Search for `claude-code-skills` or `dominion-flow-skills` to find repos shared by the community

**Installing skills from GitHub:**
```bash
claude plugin install <github-username>/<repo-name>
```

You can also create your own skills as you work. When Claude discovers a useful pattern, `/fire-add-new-skill` saves it to your library automatically.
