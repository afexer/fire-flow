- Plan file path should be mentioned

---

## After /fire-3-execute

```markdown
# Project State

## Current Phase
Phase N: [Phase Name] (Execution Complete | Breath M of W)

## Session Context

- [List of created/modified project files]

## Last Updated
[ISO timestamp]
```

### Validation Rules
- If execution complete, current phase should indicate completion
- Created files should be listed

## After /fire-4-verify

```markdown
# Project State

## Current Phase
Phase N: [Phase Name] (Verified | Incomplete)

## Session Context

## Active Tasks
- [x] Plan Phase N
- [x] Execute Phase N
- [x] Verify Phase N completion (or [ ] if incomplete)
- [ ] Plan Phase N+1 (if Phase N complete)

## Blockers
[Any verification failures, or "None"]

## Technical Notes
[Summary of verification results]

## Files Modified This Session
- .planning/CONSCIENCE.md (updated)

## Last Updated
[ISO timestamp]
```

### Validation Rules
- VERIFY.md path should be mentioned
- If verification failed, blockers should reflect issues
- Next phase task should appear if current phase passed

---

## After /fire-5-handoff

```markdown
# Project State

## Current Phase
Phase N: [Phase Name] ([Status])

## Session Context
- Session handoff created
- Handoff file: ~/.claude/warrior-handoffs/[PROJECT]_[DATE].md
- Context preserved for next session

## Active Tasks

[Unchanged]

## Files Modified This Session
[Previous files plus handoff]
- ~/.claude/warrior-handoffs/[PROJECT]_[DATE].md (created)

## Last Updated
[ISO timestamp]
```

### Validation Rules
- Session context should mention "handoff"
- Handoff file path should be mentioned
- Other content should be preserved (not cleared)

---

## After /fire-6-resume

```markdown
# Project State

## Current Phase
[Restored from handoff]

## Session Context

[ISO timestamp - current time]
```

### Validation Rules
- Session context should mention "resume" or "restored"
- Active tasks should match handoff's pending tasks
- Last Updated should be current (not from handoff)

## Validation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate CONSCIENCE.md structure

STATE_FILE="${1:-.planning/CONSCIENCE.md}"

# Check file exists
[ -f "$STATE_FILE" ] || { echo "FAIL: CONSCIENCE.md not found"; exit 1; }

# Check required sections
SECTIONS=("## Current Phase" "## Session Context" "## Active Tasks" "## Blockers" "## Last Updated")
for section in "${SECTIONS[@]}"; do
    grep -q "$section" "$STATE_FILE" || { echo "FAIL: Missing section: $section"; exit 1; }
done

# Check timestamp format (ISO-like)
TIMESTAMP=$(grep -A1 "## Last Updated" "$STATE_FILE" | tail -1)
[[ "$TIMESTAMP" =~ ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} ]] || { echo "FAIL: Invalid timestamp format"; exit 1; }

echo "PASS: CONSCIENCE.md structure valid"
```

## Notes

- Section order may vary
- Additional sections are allowed
- Content within sections may vary based on project
- Timestamps should be reasonably current
